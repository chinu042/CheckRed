we can monitor load balance and free memory of system resource or service using "top" and "free" commands.
In case of chipcart we can set a trigger pointer for free memory if it hits that perticular trigger then we get to know that how much time we left to scale the infrastructure.
And to get the average load and free memory we can use nginx service.
